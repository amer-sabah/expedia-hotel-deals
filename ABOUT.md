I used Java as back-end language because I have more than 8 years experience in it, and 2 years experience in Spring Framework.
I used Bootstrap as front-end framework to complete the front end part, I don't have enough experience in bootstrap but I know the concept of it. So I can handle basic things in it.


I have a good experience in GitHub because I used it in Reserveout company.
The Heroku and Travis CI are new experience for me, and I enjoyed my time during this assignment to work on them, and really I like this way in development.

My accomplishments:
1. Developed the simple site using Java.
2. Used Spring as Java Framework because it is very easy to use and powerful.
3. Used Lombok project to simplify the way when encapsulate classes using @Data.
4. Used Junit for testing and applied on LocalDateConverterTest class as approach for testing.
5. Used Github to manage source code.
6. Used Bootstrap as front end framework to simplify the HTML and CSS part.
7. Hosted the application on Heroku.
8. Used Travis CI to test and deploy my application directly to Heroku when the Github branch got any new change (New experience for me)
